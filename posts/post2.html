              After helping hundreds of new bloggers, I've identified these five
              critical mistakes that sabotage most beginners. Avoid these and
              you'll be ahead of 90% of new bloggers.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Not Defining a Clear Niche</h2>
            <p>
              Trying to be everything to everyone results in being nothing to
              anyone. Successful blogs focus on a specific audience with
              specific problems. A "food blog" is too broad - "quick paleo meals
              for busy professionals" gives you focus.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Inconsistent Posting Schedule</h2>
            <p>
              Readers crave reliability. Whether it's once a week or twice a
              month, set a realistic schedule and stick to it. Google also
              rewards consistency with better search rankings.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Ignoring SEO Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>
              Writing great content isn't enough if no one can find it. Learn
              basic keyword research, proper heading structure (like these H2
              tags), and meta descriptions. Tools like Google's Keyword Planner
              are free.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Neglecting Email List Building</h2>
            <p>
              Social media algorithms change, but your email list is yours
              forever. Start collecting emails from day one with a simple lead
              magnet like a checklist or cheat sheet.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Giving Up Too Soon</h2>
            <p>
              Most blogs see minimal traffic for the first 6-9 months. The
              bloggers who succeed are those who persist through this "dark
              period" while consistently improving their craft.
